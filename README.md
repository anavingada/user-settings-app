## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

As TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, the `tsc` CLI was replaced by `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, such as VSCode, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.
